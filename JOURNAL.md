## 11/1/2025 - First time doing PCB ! (alot of fun)  

A couple of days earlier i was contemplating about how to make the development drop, but i got a notif in my gmail that BluePrint make a simple tutorial and i become confident. I put my effort in this project in just 2 days and i really enjoy it ALOT, i have a prevoius knowledge on circuits in proteus so it helps me alot and also with the help of Blueprint easy guide. so after this i would do my next project on developing boards perhaps MIDI or make a mini microcontroller!
